A  stupid tool  I  vomited  out in  Python  to  help manage  Alternity
character data.

1 Quick Start 
==============
To make a new character, run the manager.py script with no arguments:

 $ python manager.py

When you exit, character's current data will automatically be saved to
a file with the .alternity extension.

To  retrieve character  data from  disk, make  sure the  last argument
passed into the manager.py script is the name of the character file.

 $ python manager.py my_character_data.alternity

To e-mail the character data to your GM, try this:

 $ python manager.py -d my_character_data.alternity | mail -s "My character" gamemaster@webealternityfans.org

To see the  list of available commands, type "/help"  in the character
manager.

 $ echo '/help' | python manager.py my_character_data.alternity

2 Managing Character Data 
==========================
To list  all the stats  that are tracked by  this tool, use  the /list
command:

     > /list
     ==== Known stats...
     acrobatics              act                     
     administration          air_vehicle             
     animal_handling         animal_riding

     wil                     xenology                
     xenomedicine            zero_gravity_training   
     zoology                 
     
To set values  for character data, type the data  name followed by the
new  value you  want set  for  it.  Once  you hit  ENTER, the  updated
character information should be shown.

     My Example Character: Human, Combat Spec
     Str:  7 ( 3 ) 0
     Dex:  7 ( 3 ) 0
     Con:  7 ( 3 ) 
     Int:  7 ( 3 ) 0
     Wil:  7 ( 3 ) 0
     Per:  7 ( 3 ) 
     Total ability scores: 42
     > str 12
     My Example Character: Human, Combat Spec
     Str: 12 ( 6 ) 1
     Dex:  7 ( 3 ) 0
     Con:  7 ( 3 ) 
     Int:  7 ( 3 ) 0
     Wil:  7 ( 3 ) 0
     Per:  7 ( 3 ) 
     Total ability scores: 47

If you want  to increase or decrease the stat  relative to its current
value, precede the value with a "+" or "-" like so...

     My Example Character: Human, Combat Spec
     Str: 12 ( 6 ) 1
     Dex:  7 ( 3 ) 0
     Con:  7 ( 3 ) 
     Int:  7 ( 3 ) 0
     Wil:  7 ( 3 ) 0
     Per:  7 ( 3 ) 
     Total ability scores: 47
     > str +1
     My Example Character: Human, Combat Spec
     Str: 13 ( 6 ) 2
     Dex:  7 ( 3 ) 0
     Con:  7 ( 3 ) 
     Int:  7 ( 3 ) 0
     Wil:  7 ( 3 ) 0
     Per:  7 ( 3 ) 
     Total ability scores: 48
     > str -2
     My Example Character: Human, Combat Spec
     Str: 11 ( 5 ) 1

     Wil:  7 ( 3 ) 0
     Per:  7 ( 3 ) 
     Total ability scores: 46

Set skill levels the same way:

     Con:  7 ( 3 )

     Per:  7 ( 3 ) 
     Total ability scores: 46
     Interaction................ 5 [12/6/3] 21
     
Stat names are case insensitive.

     Wil:  7 ( 3 ) 0
     Per:  7 ( 3 ) 
     Total ability scores: 46
     Interaction................ 2 [9/4/2] 6
     
If  there  are any  spaces  in  the  stat's  name, replace  them  with
underscores.

     > computer_science 1

     Str: 11 ( 5 ) 1

     Total ability scores: 46

     Interaction................ 2 [9/4/2] 6

Specialty  skills  also  work  and are  cleanly  annotated  under  the
appropriate Broad skill.

3 Exiting the Manager 
======================
You quit by either typing the  "/quit" command or sending EOF.  That's
CTRL+Z in Windows systems and CTRL+D on computers for grown-ups.

4 To-do list 
=============
 - Add a die roller script
 - Make the code less hideously ugly
 - Add perks/flaws
 - Add psionic crap

5 Legal Mumbo Jumbo 
====================
The Alternity  RPG belongs to  whoever it is  that ended up  buying it
(not me).   I'm pretty  sure any  owner of the  game is  reserving all
their rights like folks tend to do.
